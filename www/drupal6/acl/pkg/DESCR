The ACL module, short for Access Control List, is an API for other modules
to create lists of users and give them access to nodes. It has no UI of its
own and will not do anything by itself, but it is required by the following
modules

* Content Access (optionally uses ACL to provide by-user access control)
* Flexi Access
* Forum Access
* Image Gallery Access
