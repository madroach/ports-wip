This module changes your forum administration page to allow you to set forums
private. You can control what user roles can view, edit, delete, and post to
each forum. You can also give each forum a list of users who have
administrative access on that forum (AKA moderators).

This module requires the ACL module in order to function.

Forum Access is compatible with the core Forum module, Advanced Forum, and
Content Access, Domain Access as well as all other well-behaved node access
modules.
