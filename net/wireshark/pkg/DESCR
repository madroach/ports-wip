Wireshark is the world's foremost network protocol analyzer, and is the
de facto (and often de jure) standard across many industries and
educational institutions.

Wireshark development thrives thanks to the contributions of networking
experts across the globe. It is the continuation of a project that
started in 1998.

This is provided as a display / analysis tool, and is not intended for
use in capturing traffic, use tcpdump for captures.
